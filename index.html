    <p> 
      Black Desert Online is a MMO created by the Korean company Pearl Abyss. Originally released
      in Korea, Japan, and Russa in 2015, North America release and Europe was a year later.
      Currently as of 2023, there are <strong>26 classes</strong> to choose from. Classes are then divided into
      three different attacking groups: <strong>melee, range, and magic</strong>. Each class has its own weaknesses
      and strengths in both PvE and PvP stand points. However, it is up to the player in finding
      what they like to play, regardless of any advantage a specific class might have.
